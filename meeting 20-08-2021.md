## Meeting 20.08.2021 


### Deliverables : 

- [x] customize Threads (send CAN message, wakeup periodically) (13 Aug) 
- [x] send & receive CAN message using Portenta (13 Aug) 
- [x] transfer loiTruck code to Portenta H7 (20 Aug) 
- [ ] test them on the box (20 Aug)

#### Customize Threads
Things done
Setup:
- 3 Threads:
    - Thread engine 
        - wake up every 500ms
        - send a fake Heart Beat
        - print out "engine"
    - Thread brake
        - wake up every 500ms
        - send a fake Heart Beat
        - print out "brake"
    - Main thread
        - where loiTruck object run:
            - receive CAN message
            - reply CAN message
            - send the rest fake Heart Beat

Open question:
- can not declare MCP2515 object globally (ifndef instead)
- need to review documentation to confirm parallelism of Threads

#### send & receive CAN message using Portenta
Things done
Setup:
- using MCP2515:
    - connect via SPI protocol         
    - loiTruck object is hardcoded properties (RUN_MODE, RUN_MODE_APPLY)

Open question:
- can we use CAN transceiver modul to utilize CAN port (https://www.reichelt.com/de/en/can-bus-controller-can-lin-transceiver-dip-8-mcp-2561-e-p-p143742.html?&trstct=pos_0&nbc=1)


#### transfer loiTruck code to Portenta H7
Things done
Setup
- reused almost loiTruck code (except error simulating functions)
- loiTruck run on main thread
- MCP2515 and Servo lib still run properly

Open question:
- MCP2515 object cannot be declared globally

#### test them on the box
Things done
Setup
- Servo control via Potentiometer
- LCD display
- MCP2515

Open question:
- Interrupt (documentation is not cleared)
- joystick (GPIO Pin is not working properly)
- breakout board header is so loose --> need to solder with socket connector https://www.reichelt.com/de/en/socket-connector-1-27mm-1x4-straight-bkl-10120642-p266613.html?&nbc=1&trstct=lsbght_sldr::235460
