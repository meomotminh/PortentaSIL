# MCP2561 High-Speed CAN Transceiver

Featzres:
- 1 Mb/s Operation
- Standard Physical Layer Requirements
- Very Low Standby CUrrent
- Vio suppy Pin to interface directly to CAN Controllers and MC with 1.8V to 5.5V
- SPLIT Output Pin to Stabilize Common Mode in Biased Split Termination SChemes
- CAN Bus Pins disconnected when Device is Unpowered
- Detection of Ground Fault:
    - Permanent Dominant Detection on TXD
    - Permanent Dominant Detection on Bus
- Power-on Reset and Voltage Brown-Out protection on VDD pin
- Protection against Damage due to Short-Circuit


- Work as interface between CAN protocol controller and physical 2-wire CAN bus

## Device Overview

2 modes of operations:
- Normal :
    - STBY Pin: LOW
    - Rxd pIN: 
        - LOW -> bus is dominant
        - HIGH -> bus is recessive
- Standby :
    - STBY Pin: HIGH
    - Rxd Pin:
        - LOW -> Wake-up request is detected
        - HHIGH -> no Wake-up request

### Transmitter Function:

CAN bus has 2 state: Dominant and Recessive
- Dominant: differential voltage between CANH and CANL is greater than VDIFF
- Recessive: differential voltage less than VDIFF

### Receiver Function

- In Normal mode, Rxd output pin reflects the differential bus voltage between CANH and CANL
    - LOW, HIGH : Dominant, Recessive

### Permanent Dominant detection

- in Normal mode, if MCP256 detect an extended Low state on Txd input -> disaple CANH and CANL output driver
- in Standby mode, it will set Rxd pin to Recessive state -> aööpw attached controller to go to Low-Power mode until dominat issue is corrected
- allow 18 consecutive dominant bits on the bus

### Power-On Reset and Unservoltage Detection

- threshold : 1.2V for Vio and 4V for Vdd
- Once Power on, CANH and CANL enter high-impedance state if voltage level at Vdd drops below undervoltage level -> brown-out protection
- in Normal mode, receiver output is forced to Recessive during undervoltage condition in Vdd
- in Standby mode, low-power receiver is only enabled when bothe Vdd and Vio supply  voltages rise above undervoltage

#### Txd

- CAN transceiver drive the differential output pin CANH and CANL according to Txd
- usually connceted to transmitter data output of CAN controller
- Txd Low -> CANH and CANL are in Dominant State
- Txd High -> Recessive
- Txd is connected to an internal pull-up resistor to Vdd

#### Rxd

- Rxd is CMOS-compatible output drives High or LOw depend on differential signals on CANH and CANL pins
- connected to Receiver data input of CAN controller
- Rxd High -> Recessive
- Rxd Low -> Dominant

#### SPLIT PIN

- reference voltage output (Vdd/2), only active in Normal mode
- in Standby mode or VDD off, SPLIT floats
