### Deliverable : Components of loiTruck

- [x] MCP2515
- [x] LCD (with errors)
- [x] Touchscreen
- [ ] Joystick (error in clicking)
- [ ] Potentiometer (not yet)

### Things have done
#### MCP2515

- Control via SPI protocol (old approach)
- 3 sources send CAN message:
    - main loop : send list of 24 fake CAN msg
    - brake thread : send 1 heart beat msg every 500ms
    - engine thread : send 1 heart beat msg every 500ms
- Problems:
    - Pin connections are very unstable -> difficult to test 
    - use of 4 SPI pin -> might save 2 if use CAN pins (need CAN transceiver)

#### LCD 20x4

- Display 2 first masks : Start Calibration & labTruck version...
- Problems:
    - Pin connection are very unstable
    - Joystick function not working properly to control change mask

#### Joystick

- Go up and down (work but still have errors)
- Problems:
    - Click function -> Board Crash (maybe because of using uncorrect Pin to call digitalRead)


#### Touchscreen

- Work properly
